Email instructions for git/github friday noon seminar ad

Things you should do ahead of time:

DEFINITELY DO THIS
1) Sign up for a github account
- github.com
- pick a username/password/email
- important: use an email that ends in .edu
- choose the "free" plan (you can later upgrade to the micro plan for free with your .edu email)

OPTIONAL BEFORE FNS
1b) If you want to upgrade to the micro plan (free private repositories)
- https://education.github.com/, click "request a discount" (takes you to https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)
- fill out and you'll eventually get an email that informs you you've been upgraded to the micro plan

DEFINITELY DO THIS
2) Install git (the revision control system that tracks changes to docs and folders)
- https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
- Do the steps in the "setting up git" section 
- You might need to upgrade your operating system if you're way behind
- Ignore everything below "Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git" (we're not going to deal with the command line)
- This video walks through the website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI3yVcSahzk&index=2&list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD

DEFINITELY DO THIS
3) Install the Github software (which allows you to use git without using the command line)
- https://mac.github.com/ 
OR 
- You might have just downloaded this when you downloaded git in step (2), since Github directed Windows users to get git bundled with the Github software
- If you already had git but now need Github For Windows, you can find it here: https://windows.github.com/
- You might need to upgrade your operating system if you're way behind

That's it!  We'll walk through how to use each of these tools during FNS.
